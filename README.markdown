What does it do?
================
A complete user community, including logging in, creating accounts, sending messages , buddylists, ignorelists and searching users. It has support for different membership levels ('normal', 'VIP' and 'crew'). It's kinda like loginbox_macmade, sr_feuser_register and cwt_community (and its dependencies) all in one. HOI Community uses templates and locallang.xml files, CSS stylesheets and Typoscript constants for complete control. And did I mention XHTML valid default templates?

Features
========
- Creating accounts, with a password-strength checker.
- After creating an account an email will be send. The user must activate his account.
- Logging in into the frontend.
- Creating a profile with fields such as birthday, location, name, information and an image. A user profile will also show his online status, last time he logged in and the date he created his account.
- It uses a nice Javascript calendar for birthday input. No longer a user needs to use textfields in yyyy-mm-dd format.
- Buddylist: add or remove a user to/from your buddylist.
- A list of all online users. Users with “VIP” rights, users with admin rights (“Crew”) and buddies will be shown in a different color (done with css).
- Administration in the frontend: admin users can edit profiles just as the user himself could do.
- Sending messages to each other, with support for quotes
- Parse strings in messages and profiles for emoticons (or smiley's if you will).
- Basic BBCode support in profiles for users in the extraFeatures group (the so-called VIP users).
- A list of all users, sorted by first letter of their username.
- A welcome view, showing how many new messages a user has.
- A search function.
- Ignorelists: users you add to your ignorelist can no longer send you messages.

Notes
=====
This project was created in 2006, and orphaned in 2007. I am putting this code on my GitHub account so it doesn't get lost forever, but I don't plan to develop it futher.
